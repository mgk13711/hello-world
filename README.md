my first git repo

Hello world

This is my first github test.
I want to be a good programmer, so I can make my own service.

I've worked as an R&D engineer for 5 years, but I've never tried github.
I want to make this time as a turning point of mine.

1 day 1 commit!
small writing or just commenting is okay.

Today I'm learning github system. How to commit and branching.
